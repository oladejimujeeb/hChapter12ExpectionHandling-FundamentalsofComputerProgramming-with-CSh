From both the semantics and the technical meaning, Exception handling is solely the needful prepration for an unwanted
occurrence in the course of executing a program. 
Exceptions are also cursors indicating an unexpected interruption by the program code. 
In instances like this, we create an exception object and call the exception handler code. 
The execution of an execption handler so that the program code doesnt crash is called exception handling.
Exception are catched by wrapping the whole code in a try block. that is if there is any exception or if any exception occur
and then a catch bloock at the to catch the incoming exception so as to avoid the program from breaking. then the measage 
will be display in the catch block. and it is also possible to inherit Exception from a base class Exception. 

The processes for catching exceptions are as follows:
Create a try{} - catch(){} - finally{} statement.
