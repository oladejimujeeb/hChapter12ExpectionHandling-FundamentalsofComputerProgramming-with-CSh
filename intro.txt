Climate is defined according to Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), as “average weather,” usually described in terms of the mean and variability of temperature, precipitation and wind over a period of time. Climate change therefore, refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and which persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcing such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere (e.g. greenhouse gases) or in land use (IPCC, 2012). The evidence that the climate system is warming is unequivocal. In consistency with global observations, Nigeria has recorded high values of precipitation intensity, frequency, and duration in the last three decades, more than any preceding decade (Adeoluwa et al., 2017).
